RCU - LF Live Mentorship
========================

RW locks
 - block subsequent cnflicting operations
- time based mututal exclusion

Disadvantage - As no of cpus (threads) increase, time for operation increases rapidly.

Global agreement is expensive - HW latency


Solution
-------
- RCU'

- maybe stale but consistent data


temporal and spatial synchronization



Phased state change
