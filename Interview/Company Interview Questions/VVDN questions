1. Differences between process and thread.
2. WAP to do the following:

	res=a*b;
	
   without using '*' operator. You are allowed to use bitwise,+,- operators only.

3. Design a system so that irrespective of the polarity of the input , output will always be +ve voltage.
ans>> full wave rectifier.

4. Design a digital system that will convert a wave of time period of 10ms with 50% duty cycle to a wave of same time period but with 10% duty cycle. 
ans>> use delay period of 'and' and 'not' gates.

5. I have a transormer of turns ratio as 1:10, can I connect a fan to the secondary if the input is 24V to the primary? What factors will decide how many fans I can connect????
ans>> yes i can connect provided the supply is 1 phase supply. The factors are:
		-> since the household wiring are parallel type so, a current divider circuit will be produced if I keep on adding a fan and as a result a point of time 			   the current will become insufficient i.e. will fall below the rated value.

6.
	a()
	{
		a();
	}

	output??

7. I have five rings. I want to coonect them in a straight line. How many rings I will have to break??

ans>> 2

8. Say a pin of the micro controller is zero, can I make it 1 by connecting another pin from another micro controller which has 1 on it???
ans>> NO, because it will bypass the the current to ground and it will not enter the uc.

9. External and internal fragmentation??  [Siemens]

10. when do we need a interfacing chip for a peripheral??




THANK YOU VERY VERY VERY MMMMUUUCCCHHH   VECTOR!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
