****************  Selection Procedure for ROCKWELL COLLINS*********************

1.written round:
-consisted of 50 ques, 25 from c,c++ (basics) & 25 from aptitude(RS aggarwal).
 No negative marking.
(candidates above 28 marks were shortlisted for the next round).

2.Technical rounds:
First : 
a. what do you mean by static keyword used in class? 
b. where are intialized & uninitialized static variables stored?
c. what is DMA? explain in both c & c++.
d. what is virtual keyword used for?
e. what is run time polymorphism & explain by writing the code.
f. define the layers in OSI model- their work & protocol used.(project based)
g. Difference b\w a switch & a router ? In which layer of OSI are they used?
h. What is interface? (java)
i. How to avoid memory leak? 

Second:
a. write the code for preorder traversal of BST using recursion.
b. difference between overriding & overloading?
c. difference bw virtual &  pure virtual functions?
d. write the code for reversing the linked list.
e. puzzle: There are 8 balls, out of which 7 balls are of equal weight. you are given a balance to weight. In minimum, how many times can you 
   know, which is the lighter one?
  (Ans: 3)
   (explanation: divide 8 balls in 2 halves.weigh them ,put aside the lighter 4. Divide these 4 balls into 2 halves, weigh them. Put aside the lighter 2.
   Weigh each. Thus, lighter ball is found).
f. puzzle: there are 2 jugs. one with 4l & one with 5l of capacity. how will you   get 3l ?
  (Ans : fill 4l jug & pour it into 5l jug. Now, 5l jug has the capacity to hold 1l only. Again fill 4l jug & pour 1l into 5l jug. The remaining water in 4l
   jug is 3l.)

Third:(technical cum Hr)
a. DIFFERENCE BW tcp & udp?
b. write the code for sorting the string "Rockwellcollins" using quicksort.
c. puzzle: There is a loaf of bread.I want to cut it into 8 pieces,by using the knife atmost 3 times.
  (Ans: cut the loaf in 2 halves (knife used 1ce).put one slice on another.
   again cut in 2 halves, it gives 4 slices(knife used twice). again,put the 2 
   slices over the other 2. Again ,cut in 2 halves, it will give total 8 pieces
   (knife used thrice)).
d. Advantages of c over java?
e. General HR questions.
