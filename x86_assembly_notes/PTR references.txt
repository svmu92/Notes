25. Directives BYTE PTR, WORD PTR, DWORD PTR
There are times when we need to assist assembler in translating references to data in memory.

For example, instruction

        mov     [ESI], al  ; Store a byte-size value in memory location pointed by ESI
suggests that an 8-bit quantity should be moved because AL is an 8-bit register.

When instruction has no reference to operand size,

        mov     [ESI], 5   ; Error: operand must have the size specified
To get around this instance, we must use a pointer directive, such as

        mov     BYTE PTR [ESI], 5  ; Store 8-bit value
        mov     WORD PTR [ESI], 5  ; Store 16-bit value
        mov     DWORD PTR [ESI], 5 ; Store 32-bit value
These instructions require operands to be the same size.

In general, PTR operator forces expression to be treated as a pointer of specified type:

        .DATA
        num  DWORD   0

        .CODE
        mov     ax, WORD PTR [num] ; Load a word-size value from a DWORD
